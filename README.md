Gift Vouchers are on the rise, with more and more employers -- and employees -- realising their benefits.\
Research has found plenty of benefits for incentivising and rewarding staff using vouchers over cash rewards, with the personal value of receiving rewards such as gift cards and vouchers typically far exceeding the actual cash rewards.
